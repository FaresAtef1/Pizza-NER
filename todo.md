- [x] Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning, Tokenization
- [x] Parse the raw dataset into a trainable structure (Create a map between the raw input and its corresponding label)
- [x] Map example:
```js
map = {
  "can": "none",
  "i": "none",
  ...
  "large": "SIZE"
}
```
- [x] Extract features like word embeddings and contextual embeddings
- [x] Try different models like RNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU 
- [x] Try different optimizers like Adam, NAdam,SGD
- [x] Handle cases like "bbq pulled pork"
- [x] Handle Not
